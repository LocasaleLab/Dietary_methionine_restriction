# Dietary_methionine_restriction
Code and scripts for analyzing metabolomics datasets for mice and human subjects undergoing dietary methionine restriction (MR). 

## Description of folders
- **Chemotherapy**: MATLAB scripts for analyzing metabolomics data for the combinational treatment of MR and chemotherapy (5-FU).
- **Methionine_metabolites**: MATLAB scripts for extracting metabolites within certain distance from methionine (i.e. methionine-related metabolites) in the human genome-scale metabolic network Recon2
- **PDX**: MATLAB scripts for analyzing metabolomics data for the patient-derived xenograft models of CRC
- **Plasma**: MATLAB scripts for analyzing metabolomics data for the plasma samples from different models
- **Sarcoma**: MATLAB scripts for analyzing metabolomics data for the Sarcoma models
- **Time_course**: MATLAB scripts for the singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of time-course data in plasma of mice eating control/MR diets

## Usage
The scripts were written and tested in MATLAB R2018b. To run the scripts, execute the .m file in the corresponding folder.
